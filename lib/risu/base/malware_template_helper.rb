				@output.text "Conficker Worm infections were found on #{conficker_count} of #{Report.title}'s computer systems. Conficker, also known as Downup, Downadup and Kido, is a computer worm targeting the Microsoft Windows operating system that was first detected in November 2008. It uses flaws in Windows software and dictionary attacks on administrator passwords to propagate while forming a botnet, and has been unusually difficult to counter because of its combined use of many advanced malware techniques. The systems of interest are detailed in the detailed findings report with remediation steps."
